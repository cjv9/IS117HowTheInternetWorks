            <p>
                <b>DNS</b></br>
                Domain Name System</br>
                Translates domain names to ip addresses, used to direct users to websites.</br>

                <b>Root Name servers</b></br>
                Servers that store and deliver addresses to sites to devices, they each have specific domain to deal
                with, one only containing ‘.com’, and another ‘.net’.</br>

                <b>ISP</b></br>
                Internet Service Provider</br>

            </p>
            <p>
                DNS connects a device which inputs a web address to its corresponding ip address, which allows the
                device to access and be able to use the site searched for. Domain names are used to lookup associated IP
                addresses to send the device to the website.
                You can think of this like sending a letter, the sender doesn’t need to know the person they’re
                communicating with, but does need to know their address. Likewise, when searching for a website, the
                user doesn’t need to know it’s ip address, but does need to know their domain name. To visit a website,
                a device messages a server to ask for the site's ip address, and is sent back a packet using this
                address.
                One of the main reasons domain names are used instead of just the ip addresses, are because a series of
                numbers is harder to recall than a name.
            <p>
                Searching for a website looks something like this:
                First, the user inputs the site they want to visit into a search engine. A check for ‘DNS cache’, is
                quickly made to determine if the user has previously visited the site. If they have, the ip address
                found in the cache is used to direct the user to the site.
                If no DNS cache is found, a request is sent out to the user's ISP’s server, wherein the ip address is
                searched for in the ISP’s DNS records. If found, a packet is sent back containing the ip address, and
                the user is directed to the site.
                If the ip address is not found in the ISP’s server’s DNS cache, a request is then sent out to the
                responsible ‘root nameserver’, wherein the address will be located, and sent back to the device, which
                will direct the user to the site requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DNS system is very useful, but is very open, so it is vulnerable to attacks and interceptions.
                DNS spoofing is common, http sites which are less secure can be rerouted to identical fake sites. Users
                who use this fake site are vulnerable to have their information stolen, so it’s always recommended to
                always use secure connections.
