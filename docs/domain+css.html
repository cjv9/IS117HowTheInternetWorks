            <h1>Domain Names and ICANN</h1>

            <p><b>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</b><br>
                ICANN is a nonprofit that maintains and manages the domain names and numbers of the Internet, which
                ensures
                that the Internet continues to be stable, and have integrity.
            <p>
            </p>
            To be able to communicate with other devices, websites, and people online, you need a unique address, an IP
            address. Without the maintenance ICANN performs of these, secure communication would not be possible. One of
            the many things ICANN does is make community policies which allow technology to keep evolving in a way that
            ensures interoperability. ICANN also deals with enforcing their contractual compliance policies, which
            ensure the Internet community members are in compliance with ICANN's regulations of accountability,
            transparency, and are in favor of the interest of Internet users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The makeup of ICANN is as follows:</b><br>
                ICANN has, first and foremost, two groups who advise its board of directors, the At-Large Advisory
                Committee(ALAC) and the Government Advisory Committee(GAC). These committees are composed of several
                diverse
                representatives of large communities of ‘stakeholders’. Other committees such as the Root Server System
                Advisory Committee(RSSAC) and the Security and Stability Advisory Committee(SSAC), give technical advice
                to
                the board of directors, all respective to their concentrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                ICANN also develops policy proposals through three main supporting organizations, the Generic Names
                Supporting Organization (GNSO), the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (CCNSO), and the Address
                Supporting Organization (ASO). The most prominent of the three is the GNSO which is composed of
                representatives of big ‘stakeholder groups’ who are concerned with top-level domains. The last two deal
                with
                country code top-level domains, and the distribution of IP addresses along the five groups of regional
                Internet registries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last group are the staff are those who actually implement the policies accepted, and the board of
                directors who make, mend, and oversee laws and regulations designed to ensure fairness of the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Why do we ‘use’ ICANN?</b><br>
                Domain names are letter combinations by which sites are identified as, and ICANN performs both physical
                and
                virtual maintenance of root name server sites, and of policies surrounding domain, IPV4, and IPV6
                addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                As aforementioned, Internet sites are only accessible by IP addresses, however, those are not very user
                friendly. So instead of long strings of numbers, we use domain names to search for and request a desired
                sites’ IP address, in the user end. These IP addresses are maintained by ICANN, and they are the only
                reason
                we are able to use the Internet with the facility we see today. ICANN provides the Internet scope with
                maintenance and stability, and the ability to keep evolving and serving its users.
