            <p>
                <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</b></br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypertext is the language used in, ‘get requests’, sent from a browser to request html code to load a
                page,
                file, or a document from a server. Both HTTP and DNS manage the sending or receiving of web files (html
                media files).
            <p>
                HTTP sends and receives packets in cleartext, and if intercepted, can easily be read. As information is
                likely to be exchanged during the use of a site, HTTP is not recommended to be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP post requests send a request with data attached, which the server reads, and answers with what is
                being
                requested. Cookies are also sent which are “numbers” that ID a user to the website. So if you accept a
                website's cookies and login multiple times, each time the site will recognize you by your ID, and use
                the
                data previously collected to target ads, or generally collect data.
            <p>
                HTTPS, on the other hand, sends and receives encrypted packets, and makes activity such as online
                shopping
                and logging into accounts secure. Furthermore, HTTPS utilizes SSL and TLS to protect information from
                ‘snooping’. HTTPS sites ensure security, as to be labeled so, they need a digital certificate that
                legitimizes the site.
            </p>

            <p>We use HTTPS to be able to safely online shop, input sensitive information like SSN’s, do online banking,
                and make payments. Both HTTP and HTTPS are utilized to transfer information from the site to the server,
                and
                to display content, such as images. Images or videos actually have their own links, so the device has to
                send separate HTTP requests to display them, and they load as the packets arrive.
